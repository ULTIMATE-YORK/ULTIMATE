# Dynamic Power Management (DPM) for Foreign Exchange (FX) System Case Study

## Overview
This case study examines a **foreign exchange (FX) service-based system**[1] that automates financial transactions and relies on a **dynamic power management (DPM) component** [2,3] to optimize power consumption for its database operations.

## System Description

The **FX system** performs automated trading and market analysis, relying on a database for processing large amounts of financial data.

The **DPM component** manages the power consumption of the hard disk storing this database by switching it to a low-power **sleep mode** when idle.

Key system behaviours:
- The **DPM component** transitions the hard disk to sleep mode based on a configurable probability (**pIdle2Sleep**).
- The **FX system's transaction volume** affects the number of database operations (**diskOps**) performed.
- The **DPM queue length** (**avrQueueDiskOps**) influences how efficiently transactions are processed.

## Probabilistic Modeling

The system is represented using two **co-dependent stochastic models**:
- **DTMC model (m_fx)** for FX operations.
- **CTMC model (m_dpm)** for the DPM component.

These models interact dynamically:
- **FX transactions** impact the number of disk operations handled by DPM.
- **DPM queue length** affects the FX systemâ€™s execution speed.

## Objectives

Using ULTIMATE, we analyze the following property by varying **pIdle2Sleep**.
1. **FX Workflow Execution Time**: The expected number of transaction processing time in miliseconds.
